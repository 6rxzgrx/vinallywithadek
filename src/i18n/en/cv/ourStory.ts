	STORY_DETAILS_1: `<img src="${getImagePublicPath('ourstory/story1-1.png')}" alt="Story 1" />In a quiet corner of a campus far from the city\'s bustle, amid repeating routines and young dreams taking shape, the universe gently crossed our paths. Not through grand moments or dramatic events, but through simple laughter and lighthearted jokes—a meeting born from a playful match, one we never imagined would become the beginning of our long journey together.`,

	STORY_DETAILS_2: `<img src="${getImagePublicPath('ourstory/story2-1.png')}" alt="Story 2" />Time moved on, carrying us in different directions. Nearly three years passed without stories, without feelings, without anything at all. Yet the universe never truly forgets. In an unplanned moment, it brought us together again, as if reminding us that feelings once born never truly disappear; they simply wait for the right time to bloom once more.`,

There were times when steps felt heavy and distance rose like an unyielding wall. Time, circumstances, and challenges came one after another, testing how strong this love could endure. There were silent pauses, long moments of stillness, and unspoken longing—yet never a true goodbye.`,

	STORY_LENGTH_4: '2024',
	STORY_DETAILS_4: `<img src="${getImagePublicPath('ourstory/story4-1.png')}" alt="Story 4" />Every time the road seemed to pull us apart, there was always a way back. Like an invisible thread, fate gently guided us to find each other again. Through every temporary separation, we learned that distance is not the end, but a part of the journey leading us toward a deeper certainty.`,

	STORY_DETAILS_5: `<img src="${getImagePublicPath('ourstory/story5-1.png')}" alt="Story 5" />Along the way, we learned patience, how to strengthen one another, and how to accept each other as we are. What once grew slowly has now transformed into faith—that this is not merely a meeting, but a plan written long ago.`,
	STORY_EXPLANATION_5: 'Bringing us closer.',

	STORY_LENGTH_6: '2026',
	STORY_DETAILS_6: `<img src="${getImagePublicPath('ourstory/story6-1.png')}" alt="Story 6" />Now, with gratitude and prayer, we choose to walk the path blessed by Him. Uniting two stories, two journeys, and two hearts into one sacred bond. Marriage is not the end of our story, but the beginning of a new one—to hold each other, in joy and in sorrow, until the end of time.`,
	STORY_EXPLANATION_6: 'Forever.',

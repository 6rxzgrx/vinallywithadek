  📖 Our story didn’t happen overnight — it’s been years of laughs, debates, midnight talks, and memories we replay every day. Somewhere between coffee dates and inside jokes, we built a rhythm that just works. We’ve celebrated wins, survived chaos, and learned how to dance through life together 💃. Every minute added another beat to our story, and now we’re hitting play on the biggest chapter yet — a lifetime of choosing each other 💛❤️🤍🖤.
